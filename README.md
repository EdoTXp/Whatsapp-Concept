## üìù About

This project was originally created as part of a course by Prof. [Jamilton Damasceno](https://www.udemy.com/user/jamiltondamasceno/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/desenvolvimento-android-completo/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNINGBR).  
I have extended and refactored the codebase by introducing:

- Hilt for dependency injection
- MVVM architecture
- Result wrapper for state management
- SOLID principles and clean code practices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project uses a layered, scalable architecture:

- **Views**  
  UI components (Activities, Fragments) that observe ViewModels and render the UI.

- **ViewModels**  
  Expose state and business logic to the UI, interact with Services and Repositories, and use
  LiveData for reactive updates.

- **Services**  
  Encapsulate integration with Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) and other platform APIs.

- **Repositories**  
  Abstract data sources and business logic, providing a clean API for ViewModels.

- **Utils**  
  Utility classes and helpers used across the app.

**Dependency Injection:**  
All dependencies are managed with Hilt, ensuring testability and modularity.

**Design Patterns:**  
Repository, ViewModel, LiveData, and Result are used throughout, following SOLID and clean code
principles.
